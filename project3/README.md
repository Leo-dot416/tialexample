# Project 3: To-Do List Application

## Description
Create a to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks.

## Requirements
- Add, remove, and view tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Save tasks to a file (persistence)
- Load tasks from a file
- Include comprehensive unit tests

## Files
- `todo.py` - To-Do list class implementation
- `storage.py` - File storage functionality
- `app.py` - Main application
- `test_todo.py` - Unit tests for to-do list
- `test_storage.py` - Unit tests for storage

## Getting Started
1. Implement the ToDo class in `todo.py`
2. Implement file storage in `storage.py`
3. Implement the main app in `app.py`
4. Run tests with `python test_todo.py` and `python test_storage.py`
5. Run the application with `python app.py`

## Learning Objectives
- Object-oriented programming (classes)
- File I/O operations
- Data persistence
- Working with multiple modules
- Advanced testing techniques
