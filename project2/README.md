# Project 2: Calculator Application

## Description
Create a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Requirements
- Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions
- Handle division by zero errors
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Create a user interface (command-line)

## Files
- `calculator.py` - Calculator implementation
- `test_calculator.py` - Unit tests for the calculator
- `ui.py` - User interface for the calculator

## Getting Started
1. Implement the calculator functions in `calculator.py`
2. Implement the CLI in `ui.py`
3. Run the tests with `python test_calculator.py`
4. Run the application with `python ui.py`

## Learning Objectives
- Working with multiple functions
- Error handling (division by zero)
- Creating a command-line interface
- Comprehensive testing strategies
